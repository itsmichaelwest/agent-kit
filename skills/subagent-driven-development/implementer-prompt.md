# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]. Use programming skill to ensure your implementation meets the requirements.

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context. Coding agent will not have the full project context, so provide what they need to know to understand the task. They are not expected to make complex decisions, just implement the task as specified, if any decisions need to be made you must make those decisions yourself and include in the content and this prompt.]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Test expectations (unit/integration/e2e) or TDD requirements
    - Whether any test type can be skipped
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (follow the specified unit/integration/e2e plan and TDD requirements; do not skip test types without explicit authorization)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review (see below)
    6. Report back

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - Did I miss any requirements?
    - Are there edge cases I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the code clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I follow SOLID principles?
    - Did I avoid code duplication (DRY)?
    - Did I only build what was requested?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?
    - Do not discard any changes made by you. There may be parallel agents working on different files, discarding changes may cause loss of work for those agents. 

    **Testing:**
    - Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
    - Did I follow TDD if required?
    - Are tests comprehensive?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns
    - **CRITICAL** Write the report in `.ai_agents/session_context/{todaysdate}/{hour-based-folder-name}/coding-agent-reports/task-{taskid}-report.md`. This is critical because it ensures that the orchestrator can track progress and identify issues early and is your only mechanism for communication with the orchestrator.
