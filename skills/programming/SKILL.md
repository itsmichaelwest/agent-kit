description: Use when writing, modifying, debugging, or investigating software (not for planning or review-only tasks). Cover implementation approach, root-cause investigation, testing strategy, verification-before-completion, language guidance, and coding standards.
---

Build maintainable, testable, production-ready software. Apply DDD patterns and testing proportionate to the change. Bias coding decisions toward caution over speed; trivial tasks still require judgment.

Keep edits surgical: simplify code required by the task, preserve exact behavior, and prefer explicit readable code over dense or clever code. Broader cleanup needs explicit user approval.

Default to sub-agent delegation for programming work. For planned multi-task work, prefer `subagent-driven-development` when user/runtime permits subagents.

- Verify ideas independently; push back when requirements imply needless complexity or a simpler approach exists.
- Prefer root-cause analysis over band-aids; avoid quick fixes that hide issues.
- Before coding, state assumptions. If requirements have multiple plausible interpretations, present options with a recommendation. If intent remains unclear after reading context, ask.

## Quick Start (Required)

1. Load relevant modes and language references.
2. Read this skill top to bottom; it is the canonical source for programming workflow and coding rules.
3. Follow severity: Critical > High > Medium > Low.
4. When rules conflict: higher severity wins -> existing code patterns -> more specific language references.
5. Choose testing strategy before coding: default to TDD for behavior changes. If skipping TDD for non-behavioral work, say why and verify appropriately.
6. Load relevant role and language references as needed.
7. Run the technical-writer agent on edited files to make sure code is properly documented.
8. Run reviewer agent to review the code: spec compliance first, then code quality. Reviewer will give feedback, responsible implementer/integration owner addresses it, then reviewer re-checks.
9. Run lint, formatting, and tests to ensure everything is green before assuming success.
10. Before claiming done, fixed, passing, or ready: identify the proving command, run it fresh, read output + exit code, then state only what the evidence proves.

## Testing
- Run automated tests.
- Run interactive tests where needed and possible in tmux.
- When running test with tmux, always show user the tmux attach command so they can attach to the same tmux session to interact/watch/co-develop or debug.
  - when done close unneeded panes in tmux.

## Verification Before Completion

Evidence before claims. Do not say work is complete, fixed, passing, green, ready, or reviewed unless fresh verification in the current turn supports it.

Gate before any success claim:
1. Identify what proves the claim.
2. Run the full command or check now.
3. Read full output and exit code.
4. Compare output to the claim.
5. Report the actual state with evidence; if verification failed or was skipped, say that.

Agent reports are not evidence by themselves. Verify diffs, tests, lint, build, and requirements directly before relying on delegated work.

For details and edge cases, read [references/verification-before-completion.md](./references/verification-before-completion.md).

## Delegation Default

For programming tasks, delegate implementation, research, debugging, docs, tests, and reviews by default.

Orchestrator owns:
- user comms
- assumptions + success criteria
- architecture/product decisions
- interfaces/contracts
- dependency order
- final evidence report

When using `subagent-driven-development`:
- task implementers own task code and review fixes
- integration-owner subagent owns cross-task integration and fixes
- orchestrator verifies evidence and reports state, but does not act as integration glue by default

Dispatch rules:
- Use `subagent-driven-development` for saved plans with independent or mostly independent tasks.
- Use `developer-lite` for clear local 1-2 file mechanical work.
- Use `developer` for cross-module, API/schema/auth/security/concurrency/perf/new-dep/debugging/judgment work.
- Use `researcher` for external/current info.
- Use `technical-writer` for edited public docs, comments, and API docs.
- Use `reviewer` after implementation: `spec-compliance` first, then `code-quality`.
- For multi-agent work, run `final-integration` review over the full diff.

Stop signs:
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, `BLOCKED`, or correctness-related `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` -> add context, split, upgrade, or ask user.
- Never retry the same agent with the same prompt unchanged.
- Never make subagents read the plan as their primary task source; paste exact task text, owned scope, acceptance criteria, and tests.
- Never trust agent report alone. Verify diff + tests locally before handoff.

## Guide Index

- `issue-investigation/guide.md` -> structured investigation reports, incident triage, root-cause hypothesis ranking, and validation plans.
- `systematic-debugging/guide.md` -> required root-cause workflow for bugs, test failures, build failures, regressions, and unexpected behavior before proposing fixes.

## Rules

- **[R1-C]** Never use `--no-verify`, `--skip-checks`, or similar bypass flags when committing code.
- **[R2-C]** Never make changes unrelated to the current task. Every changed line should trace to the user request. Document unrelated issues instead of fixing them.
- **[R3-C]** Never discard an existing implementation without explicit permission.
- **[R4-C]** Fix forward. Do not add backwards-compatibility shims, compatibility layers, or temporary bridges. Remove dead transitional code only when a working replacement is in place.
- **[R5-C]** Never implement fallbacks or workarounds for failing tests; fix the underlying issue.
- **[R6-C]** For bug fixes, reproduce with a unit test first when feasible. If infeasible, say why and use the lightest viable verification.
- **[R7-C]** For new or changed behavior, write a unit or higher-level test before implementation when feasible. If the user explicitly requests TDD, follow strict Red-Green-Refactor and do not add behavior beyond the failing test. If skipping TDD for non-behavioral work, say why and verify appropriately.
- **[R8-C]** Tests must verify public behavior, not private implementation details.
- **[R9-C]** Prefer real implementations and real data over mocks when feasible.
- **[R10-C]** Think about efficiency, security, scalability, and operational impact while implementing.
- **[R11-H]** Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or overly complex ones. If implementation grows larger than needed, simplify before shipping.
- **[R12-H]** Plan before coding when the task is more than trivial. Clarify assumptions, success criteria, scope, and verification early.
- **[R13-H]** Make the smallest reasonable change that reaches the desired outcome. Do not add speculative features, single-use abstractions, unrequested configuration, or impossible-case handling. Ask before full rewrites or large reimplementations.
- **[R14-H]** Match the surrounding style, formatting, and code patterns. Consistency within the file outweighs external style guides.
- **[R15-H]** Analyze existing code purpose and structure before changing it. Ask for clarification if intent is still unclear.
- **[R16-H]** Preserve existing behavior unless tests, docs, or explicit user requirements call for a behavior change.
- **[R17-H]** Preserve helpful structure and boundaries. Do not reshape architecture without a strong reason.
- **[R18-H]** Favor immutability and explicit state transitions when practical.
- **[R19-H]** Keep comments true, timeless, and in English. Remove comments that only restate obvious code.
- **[R20-H]** Rare durable inline comments are allowed only for non-obvious constraints, invariants, or context that would otherwise be easy to miss.
- **[R21-H]** Default to fail-fast behavior with detailed errors unless the spec defines a safe recovery path.
- **[R22-H]** Exception and error messages should carry concrete context. In tests, prefer stable identifiers, types, or codes over full-message assertions.
- **[R23-H]** Apply CQS when it clarifies behavior: queries should not mutate state, and commands should not hide meaningful return values.
- **[R24-H]** Refine only code required by the task. Preserve behavior while reducing duplication, dead branches, wrappers, and unnecessary indirection introduced or exposed by the requested change. Refactors need before/after verification when feasible.
- **[R25-H]** Broaden cleanup only when explicitly requested or approved. Otherwise mention adjacent cleanup opportunities instead of editing them.
- **[R26-H]** Prefer clear control flow over dense expressions. Avoid nested ternaries when `if`/`else`, guard clauses, or `switch` are clearer.
- **[R27-H]** For behavior changes, tests must thoroughly verify desired outcomes before review or ship.
- **[R28-H]** Relevant CI workflows should pass before review or ship.
- **[R29-H]** Tests should verify one behavior at a time and stay concise. Use Given-When-Then when it improves clarity.
- **[R30-H]** Every test should contain at least one meaningful assertion.
- **[R31-H]** Tests must not cover functionality irrelevant to their stated purpose.
- **[R32-H]** Tests must close resources they open, stop waiting on timeouts, stay quiet, assume no Internet by default, avoid relying on implicit defaults when explicit inputs are clearer, and avoid asserting on logging side effects unless logging is the behavior.
- **[R33-H]** Avoid mocking the file system, sockets, memory managers, or similar core infrastructure unless necessary.
- **[R34-M]** Minor inconsistencies and typos outside the requested change should be mentioned, not fixed, unless the user asks.
- **[R35-M]** Use evergreen names. Avoid labels like `new`, `improved`, or `enhanced`.
- **[R36-M]** Keep README and user-facing docs concise, accurate, and in correct English. Update docs when behavior or API changes.
- **[R37-M]** Prefer single-sentence error or log messages without a trailing period unless project conventions differ.
- **[R38-M]** Prefer a one-to-one mapping between test files and feature files unless grouping reduces duplication.
- **[R39-M]** Use edge or irregular inputs when they matter to the behavior being tested.
- **[R40-M]** Prefer local fixtures and clean setup. Use temp directories and ephemeral ports for temporary resources.
- **[R41-M]** Inline small fixtures when practical; generate large fixtures at runtime when it keeps tests clearer and more maintainable.
- **[R42-M]** Test names should read as clear English behavior statements when the framework style supports it.
- **[R43-C]** Never make a completion, success, fixed, passing, or ready claim without fresh verification evidence from the current turn.
- **[R44-H]** Breaking changes are allowed when they are the right fix; call them out explicitly.
- **[R45-H]** Architectural smell is a stop sign. Explain the smell and ask or propose a safer path before editing around it.
- **[R46-H]** Call out conflicting instructions, requirements, or code states. Pick the safer path only when the conflict does not need user judgment.
- **[R47-H]** Treat unrecognized worktree changes as another user's or agent's work. Ignore unrelated changes; if they affect the task, work with them. If they make the task unsafe, stop and ask.
- **[R48-M]** Remove only imports, variables, and functions made unused by your own changes unless cleanup is explicitly requested.
- **[R49-M]** Leave short breadcrumb notes in the thread for decisions, blockers, or follow-up issues that should not become code changes.
